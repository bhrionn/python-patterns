# Code Pattern Examples Project

This project aims to generate high-quality code pattern examples, demonstrating best practices in software design and development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive examples of coding patterns, focusing on:

- Design patterns (GoF and Python-specific)
- SOLID principles
- Object-oriented design
- Python best practices and conventions

Each example is self-contained and includes:

- **Theory.md**: Detailed explanation of the pattern or principle, including theory, use cases, and benefits
- **example.py**: Working Python code demonstrating the pattern in practice
- **Unique directory**: Each example is organized in its own dedicated directory for clarity and organization

## Structure

```
examples/
├── pattern_name_1/
│   ├── theory.md
│   └── example.py
├── pattern_name_2/
│   ├── theory.md
│   └── example.py
└── ...
```

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the desired example directory
2. Read the `theory.md` file to understand the concept
3. Run the `example.py` file to see the pattern in action
4. Modify and experiment with the code as needed

## Contributing

When adding new examples:

1. Create a new directory under `examples/` with a descriptive name
2. Include both `theory.md` and `example.py` files
3. Ensure code follows SOLID principles and Python best practices
4. Provide comprehensive documentation in the theory file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- See individual example requirements if any# python-patterns
