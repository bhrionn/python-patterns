# Design Patterns Tasks

## Creational Patterns
- [x] Singleton - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
- [x] Factory Method - Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- [ ] Abstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- [x] Builder - Separates complex object construction from its representation, allowing step-by-step construction.
- [ ] Prototype - Creates new objects by copying existing instances (cloning).

## Behavioral Patterns
- [x] Observer - Defines a one-to-many dependency where when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.
- [ ] Chain of Responsibility - Passes requests along a chain of handlers where each handler decides to process or pass the request.
- [x] Command - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.
- [ ] Iterator - Provides sequential access to elements without exposing underlying representation.
- [ ] Mediator - Defines an object that encapsulates how objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
- [ ] Memento - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state for later restoration without violating encapsulation.
- [ ] State - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- [x] Strategy - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- [ ] Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, letting subclasses override specific steps.
- [ ] Visitor - Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on, allowing new operations without modifying classes.

## Communications Patterns (Structural)
- [x] Adapter - Converts one interface into another that clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.
- [ ] Bridge - Separates abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.
- [x] Composite - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- [x] Decorator - Adds new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- [ ] Facade - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- [ ] Flyweight - Shares common state between multiple objects to save memory.
- [ ] Proxy - Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.
